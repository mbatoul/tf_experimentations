      " |      - `CART`: CART algorithm. Find categorical splits of the form \"value \\\\in mask\". The solution is exact for binary classification, regression and ranking. It is approximated for multi-class classification. This is a good first algorithm to use. In case of overfitting (very small dataset, large dictionary), the \"random\" algorithm is a good alternative.\n",
      " |      - `ONE_HOT`: One-hot encoding. Find the optimal categorical split of the form \"attribute == param\". This method is similar (but more efficient) than converting converting each possible categorical value into a boolean feature. This method is available for comparison purpose and generally performs worse than other alternatives.\n",
      " |      - `RANDOM`: Best splits among a set of random candidate. Find the a categorical split of the form \"value \\\\in mask\" using a random search. This solution can be seen as an approximation of the CART algorithm. This method is a strong alternative to CART. This algorithm is inspired from section \"5.1 Categorical Variables\" of \"Random Forest\", 2001. Default: \"CART\".\n",
      " |    categorical_set_split_greedy_sampling: For categorical set splits e.g. texts. Probability for a categorical value to be a candidate for the positive set. The sampling is applied once per node (i.e. not at every step of the greedy optimization). Default: 0.1.\n",
      " |    categorical_set_split_max_num_items: For categorical set splits e.g. texts. Maximum number of items (prior to the sampling). If more items are available, the least frequent items are ignored. Changing this value is similar to change the \"max_vocab_count\" before loading the dataset, with the following exception: With `max_vocab_count`, all the remaining items are grouped in a special Out-of-vocabulary item. With `max_num_items`, this is not the case. Default: -1.\n",
      " |    categorical_set_split_min_item_frequency: For categorical set splits e.g. texts. Minimum number of occurrences of an item to be considered. Default: 1.\n",
      " |    compute_oob_performances: If true, compute the Out-of-bag evaluation (then available in the summary and model inspector). This evaluation is a cheap alternative to cross-validation evaluation. Default: True.\n",
      " |    compute_oob_variable_importances: If true, compute the Out-of-bag feature importance (then available in the summary and model inspector). Note that the OOB feature importance can be expensive to compute. Default: False.\n",
      " |    growing_strategy: How to grow the tree.\n",
      " |      - `LOCAL`: Each node is split independently of the other nodes. In other words, as long as a node satisfy the splits \"constraints (e.g. maximum depth, minimum number of observations), the node will be split. This is the \"classical\" way to grow decision trees.\n",
      " |      - `BEST_FIRST_GLOBAL`: The node with the best loss reduction among all the nodes of the tree is selected for splitting. This method is also called \"best first\" or \"leaf-wise growth\". See \"Best-first decision tree learning\", Shi and \"Additive logistic regression : A statistical view of boosting\", Friedman for more details. Default: \"LOCAL\".\n",
      " |    in_split_min_examples_check: Whether to check the `min_examples` constraint in the split search (i.e. splits leading to one child having less than `min_examples` examples are considered invalid) or before the split search (i.e. a node can be derived only if it contains more than `min_examples` examples). If false, there can be nodes with less than `min_examples` training examples. Default: True.\n",
      " |    max_depth: Maximum depth of the tree. `max_depth=1` means that all trees will be roots. Negative values are ignored. Default: 16.\n",
      " |    max_num_nodes: Maximum number of nodes in the tree. Set to -1 to disable this limit. Only available for `growing_strategy=BEST_FIRST_GLOBAL`. Default: None.\n",
      " |    maximum_training_duration_seconds: Maximum training duration of the model expressed in seconds. Each learning algorithm is free to use this parameter at it sees fit. Enabling maximum training duration makes the model training non-deterministic. Default: -1.0.\n",
      " |    min_examples: Minimum number of examples in a node. Default: 5.\n",
      " |    missing_value_policy: Method used to handle missing attribute values.\n",
      " |      - `GLOBAL_IMPUTATION`: Missing attribute values are imputed, with the mean (in case of numerical attribute) or the most-frequent-item (in case of categorical attribute) computed on the entire dataset (i.e. the information contained in the data spec).\n",
      " |      - `LOCAL_IMPUTATION`: Missing attribute values are imputed with the mean (numerical attribute) or most-frequent-item (in the case of categorical attribute) evaluated on the training examples in the current node.\n",
      " |      - `RANDOM_LOCAL_IMPUTATION`: Missing attribute values are imputed from randomly sampled values from the training examples in the current node. This method was proposed by Clinic et al. in \"Random Survival Forests\" (https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1223908043). Default: \"GLOBAL_IMPUTATION\".\n",
      " |    num_candidate_attributes: Number of unique valid attributes tested for each node. An attribute is valid if it has at least a valid split. If `num_candidate_attributes=0`, the value is set to the classical default value for Random Forest: `sqrt(number of input attributes)` in case of classification and `number_of_input_attributes / 3` in case of regression. If `num_candidate_attributes=-1`, all the attributes are tested. Default: 0.\n",
      " |    num_candidate_attributes_ratio: Ratio of attributes tested at each node. If set, it is equivalent to `num_candidate_attributes = number_of_input_features x num_candidate_attributes_ratio`. The possible values are between ]0, and 1] as well as -1. If not set or equal to -1, the `num_candidate_attributes` is used. Default: -1.0.\n",
      " |    num_trees: Number of individual decision trees. Increasing the number of trees can increase the quality of the model at the expense of size, training speed, and inference latency. Default: 300.\n",
      " |    sparse_oblique_normalization: For sparse oblique splits i.e. `split_axis=SPARSE_OBLIQUE`. Normalization applied on the features, before applying the sparse oblique projections.\n",
      " |      - `NONE`: No normalization.\n",
      " |      - `STANDARD_DEVIATION`: Normalize the feature by the estimated standard deviation on the entire train dataset. Also known as Z-Score normalization.\n",

      " |    split_axis: What structure of split to consider for numerical features.\n",
      " |      - `AXIS_ALIGNED`: Axis aligned splits (i.e. one condition at a time). This is the \"classical\" way to train a tree. Default value.\n",
      " |      - `SPARSE_OBLIQUE`: Sparse oblique splits (i.e. splits one a small number of features) from \"Sparse Projection Oblique Random Forests\", Tomita et al., 2020. Default: \"AXIS_ALIGNED\".\n",
